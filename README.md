# To-do-list
##Desciption

The to do list was created with reactjs and styled with TailwindCSS (mobile first).
As a user, you can add tasks, check them as done and delete them. A sorting function gives the user the possibility to change the task view between all, done or undone tasks. The tasks will be stored in local storage (after refreshing the page, your data is still there).

## How it works

I started the project by creating a new repository with create-react-app. I installed TailwindCSS by following the description of the official documentation. In Addition to the already existing component App I created a folder called components with three extra components, called Form, ToDo and ToDoList.
